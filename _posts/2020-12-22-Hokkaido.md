I recently went to Hokkaido about six months ago for a trip. It was a 5-days trip, and I had a great time there. I worried about communication problems because I cannot speak Japanese, but everyone I met in there was so kind and tried to understand my poor English/Japanese that I've never had any problems.

I visited four cities in Hokkaido including Sapporo, Furano, Biei, and Otaru. Here I list four places you might love in Hokkaido.

## Nakajima Park (Sapporo)

It usually takes about 2~3 hours to get New-chitose airport from Incheon airport, and then it takes 1 hour additional to go to Sapporo station from the airport by train. Totally, it takes a pretty long time to go to Sapporo From Seoul.

So If you are a kind of people who get exhausted quickly after a long journey, then Nakajima park in Sapporo is a great place to go. First of all, it is located at the center of the city, so you can easily get there from any hotel in Sapporo. 

It was not too crowded, quiet, and peaceful. Also, I liked that the trees were everywhere in this park.  As you can see, the park is a little different from parks in Korea. I cannot explain it precisely, but I think there is something different. Maybe textures of the streets and bench?

> Caution: One thing you must remember is that you should not enter the territory of crows. I was walking along the path (for humans of course), so I thought it must be a safe street. However, it was like a horror movie after they cawed. After few seconds, they flew towards us and almost attacked us. These little bastards were wild and vicious.

## Farm Tomita (Furano)

I've heard that 'Farm Tomita' at Furano is the best place in Hokkaido where you should go. As its name implies, it is the farm owned by Tomita family. They have been growing lavender on this farm. It was somewhat disappointing because flowers did not bloom completely. I think it will be much better when you visit here during the annual festival (usually held in late July ~ August).

If you go to Fram tomita in between July and August, you can see this.

## Blue Pond (Biei)

Blue Pond is located in Biei. It is literally a blue pond. I found an article about this pond in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Pond_(Biei)), 

> Blue Pond (青い池 Aoi-ike) is a man-made pond feature in Biei, Hokkaido, Japan. It is the result of works on the Biei River (美瑛川), carried out after the 1988 eruption of Mount Tokachi, to protect the town of Biei from volcanic mudflows. The colour is thought to result from the accidental presence of colloidal aluminium hydroxide in the water.[1][2] Damage caused by Typhoon Mindulle in August 2016 resulted in a temporary drop in the water level and in the colour briefly turning brown with mud and sand from the Biei River.[3]

The tourist guide said that we were lucky because the color of this pond depends on the weather or something. As you can see, it is bright blue. I think this pond is unique and special because it is human-made to protect the city, and its color turned into blue by some natural reason. So to speak, this beautiful pond is a kind of a result of the cooperative work between human and nature.

## Otaru Canal (Otaru)

> [Otaru](https://tadaimajp.com/2015/01/otaru/) has Hokkaido’s version of Wall street.

Otaru is a city not far away from Sapporo. This city took an important role in the economy of Hokkaido in the past. Also, this city is often called a small European village in Japan. I think this is because the beautiful canal running through Otaru makes the town look like Venice or something. Thin night view of this city was fantastic. Also, there are many famous sushi restaurants in Otaru.
