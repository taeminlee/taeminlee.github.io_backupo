Recently I watched 'Inside out' since it was a class material. (Not all of it but about three-quarters) I usually don't like to watch animation movies, but this movie was quite enjoyable. As it has been said, it has a good storyline: it is easy to understand even for children, it gives a gentle lesson for both kids and grown-ups, and most of all, it is funny. 

However, the most impressive thing in this movie to me, a student studying AI, was not the storyline but all the details they've tried to capture throughout the entire film. Story writers of this movie must have devoted their energies to describing scientific facts or hypothesis accepted widely.
